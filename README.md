# gemini-text-sh.sh
# Gemini to Shell
======================

This project provides two shell scripts, `gemini-text-sh.sh` and `gemini-text-sh-fzf.sh`, that use the Google Gemini API to convert user input into POSIX shell commands.

`gemini-text-sh.sh` takes a single argument and returns a single command.

`gemini-text-sh-fzf.sh` takes a single argument and returns multiple commands, allowing the user to select one to execute(using fzf).
